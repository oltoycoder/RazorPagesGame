# RazorPagesGame
This is a games database made in Razor Pages that displays games' information such as title, genre, number of playable chararacters.

# What is the purpose of this database?
This database shows data of various games that have come out over the years and displays important information about them. The attributes that are shown are:
* Title
* Release date
* Genre
* Number of playable characters
* Playable character gender
* Playable character race

The reason why I decided to include gender and race as part of the attributes of the game are because a lot of games are focused on white males and you rarely see games that are focused on women or people of colour so this database will be a comprehensive way of showing the games that do.

Because the database is made with Razor Pages, users can create, edit and delete the data on there as they please.
There is also a search function so users can easily search the title of the games they want to see in the database and can also filter by genre, gender and race so users don't have to sift through a lot of information to find the game they want.

The seeded games on there are:
* Telltale's The Walking Dead Season One
* Life is Strange
* The Last of Us
* Marvel's Spider-Man
